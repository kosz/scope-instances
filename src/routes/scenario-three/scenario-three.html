    <h3>3: Using the $parent scope</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/kosz/scope-instances/blob/master/src/routes/scenario-three/scenario-three.controller.js" target="_blank">code on github</a>
    <p>Services arn't always ideal. For example if our multiple controllers, live inside a ng-repeat, we will turn to our isolated scope for data storage and object sharing.</p>
    <p>One way to do that is by leveraging the $scope.$parent property, which gets passed to the controller during instantiation, and it references the scope of it's direct parent, in this case, the parent controller $scope.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/scope-creation.png" />
    <p>Two implementations come to mind here. One involves modifying <b>only the View</b> by binding $parent.value as the ng-model of the ChildCtrl input:</p>
    <pre ng-non-bindable>
  &lt;div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="ParentCtrl"&gt;
    &lt;span ng-controller="ChildCtrl"&gt;
      &lt;input ng-model="$parent.value" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    {{value}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>The other requires <b>only the JavaScript</b> to be modified, and setting the reference on ChildCtrl $scope.value to it's $scope.$parent.value</p>
    <pre>
  .controller('ChildCtrl', [
   '$scope',
    function ($scope) {
      $scope.value = $scope.$parent.value;
    }]);
    </pre>
    <p>While this solution is the least intrustive to the initial code, I feel is not necessarily the most ideal, since the view code can still look confusing, due to accessing properties directly from the $scope, from multiple $scopes and multiple controllers, maintaining an anti pattern that could have a negative impact later on down the road.</p>
