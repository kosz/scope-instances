  <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">
      The unexpected behaviour occurs because when the ChildCtrl is created it get's passed it's own scope, which is instantiated using the values from the $scope of the ParentCtrl.</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/what_happens.png">
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">This means that the ChildCtrl starts with it's $scope.value having the same value as the $scope.value of ParentCtrl, but since the $scope of ChildCtrl does not reference the same instance variable as the $scope of ParentCtrl, the two become out of sync when one changes. Since the ParentCtrl $scope.value is bound as printed text, while the ChildCtrl $scope.value is bound as a model for the input, when the ChildCtrl $scope.value input changes, the ParentCtrl $scope.value stays the same, therefore the user not being able to see his new entry reflected by the two way binding mechanism.
